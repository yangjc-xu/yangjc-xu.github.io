I am a Ph.D. candidate in [Department of Biostatistics](https://sph.unc.edu/bios/biostatistics/) at the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu), co-advised by Drs. [Danyu Lin](https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/danyu-lin-phd/) and [Donglin Zeng](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/zeng-donglin.html). Prior to that, I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Statistics from the [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/) at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn) in 2019.

Research Interests
======
My research focuses on developing novel statistical methodology and theory for survival analysis, aiming to solve cutting-edge problems arising from biomedical and public health sciences. I am particularly interested in semiparametric models and seek computationally efficient inference and model-diagnosis procedures for univariate and multivariate time-to-event data under right or interval censoring. I am also interested in developing statistical methods for large-scale administrative health data, focusing on answering scientific questions concerning high-impact infectious diseases (e.g., COVID-19 and HIV/AIDS) using big surveillance data.
