I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science](https://uwaterloo.ca/statistics-and-actuarial-science/) at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca). I received my Ph.D. in Biostatistics from the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu) in 2024, co-advised by Drs. [Danyu Lin](https://sph.unc.edu/adv_profile/danyu-lin-phd/) and [Donglin Zeng](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/zeng-donglin.html). Before that, I received my B.S. in Statistics from the [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/) at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn) in 2019.

Research Interests
======
My research focuses on developing novel statistical methodology and theory for survival analysis, aiming to solve cutting-edge problems arising from biomedical and public health sciences. I am particularly interested in semiparametric models and seek computationally efficient inference and model-diagnosis procedures for univariate and multivariate time-to-event data under right or interval censoring, with applications to cohort studies and clinical trials. I am also interested in applying statistical methods to analyze large-scale administrative health data, with a focus on using large surveillance data to answer scientific questions concerning high-impact infectious diseases such as COVID-19 and HIV/AIDS.

Openings
======
I am seeking self-motivated students to collaborate with me. If you are interested, please email me your CV along with a brief introduction about yourself.
